The development team is now investigating the cause of the problem and working to fix it. Please stay tuned to future official notifications regarding an estimated completion time.

The Express Crew will immediately notify Trailblazers via in-game notifications and player community announcements as soon as the issue is fixed. Please stay tuned for the official announcements.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused. Thank you for your understanding and support.
