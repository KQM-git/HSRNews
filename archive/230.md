Dear Trailblazers,

During the Laic Pursuit event, Trailblazers can use Star Rail Special Passes for Warps.

### Laic Pursuit Event Warp

- During the event, the drop rate of the limited 5-star character Luocha (The Abundance: Imaginary) will be boosted.

- During the event, the drop rates of the 4-star characters Yukong (The Harmony: Imaginary), Pela (The Nihility: Ice), and Qingque (The Erudition: Quantum) will be boosted.

- After the event ends, the 4-star character Yukong (The Harmony: Imaginary) will become available in Stellar Warp in Version 1.2, but will not be available in Departure Warp. Additionally, after the Version 1.2 update, Yukong (The Harmony: Imaginary) can be obtained for free if specific conditions are met.
