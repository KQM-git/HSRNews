※ Among the above Light Cones, the limited Light Cone will not become available in the Stellar Warp event.

※ This Warp is a Light Cone Event Warp. For the purposes of the guaranteed 5-star character system, the running total of Warps made always carries over from one Light Cone Event Warp to the next. Total Warps made are calculated separately for different types of Warps, which do not affect each other.

※ For more details, please head to the Warp screen.
