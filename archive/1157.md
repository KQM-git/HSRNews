"Currency Wars: Zero-Sum Game" has received a special update! The Strategic Investment Department has **strengthened numerous characters, bonds, equipment, and investment strategies** to enhance their performance in high-difficulty matches, while also fixing various anomalies.

We will continue to **optimize the Currency Wars experience** periodically to make the gameplay even more rich and engaging!

### Update Period

After the Version 3.8 update

### General Mechanics

● Fixes an issue where DoT damage type could incorrectly trigger Lucky Strike.

Based on this, we have increased the power of the DoT Bond.

● DoT Bond: Increases the DoT Amplification provided by the Bond effect.

● Enhances damage directly caused by Bonds, which increases progressively with Node advancement in the plane.

For example, the "Lightning-Lord" summoned by the Xianzhou Bond will now deal increased damage as Nodes progress.

● The maximum Shield Effect of certain effects will receive smoother increases as Nodes progress.
