Dear Trailblazers,

We sincerely apologize for the poor experience and inconvenience caused by the extension of Version 3.8.

The Express Crew will issue **Stellar Jade ×1,000 and Fuel ×10** to every Trailblazer who has unlocked the mail feature after 2025/12/08 12:00:00 (global).

Currently, the Express Crew is constantly working on Version 4.0's game content. As such, we have extended the duration of Version 3.8, in hopes to give Trailblazers a better experience in the next world, "Planarcadia."

The threat of Destruction compelled the cosmos to unite once again, and everyone now looks toward other Aeons involved. The Express once crashed into and departed from "Planarcadia." There, Aha graced the pursuers of Elation with a reward: join THEIR game and become an "Aeon" for a minute.

※ Version in development. Please regard the launch version as final.

Thank you for your continuous support and understanding, Trailblazers. See you in "Planarcadia."
