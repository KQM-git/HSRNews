Dear Trailblazer,

During the Contract Zero event, Trailblazers can use Star Rail Special Passes for Warps.

### Contract Zero Event Warp

During the event, the drop rate of the limited 5-star character Silver Wolf (The Nihility: Quantum) will be boosted.

During the event, the drop rate of the 4-star characters Dan Heng (The Hunt: Wind), Asta (The Harmony: Fire), and Serval (The Erudition: Lightning) will be boosted.

Event Duration | Drop Rate Boost: 5-Star Character | Drop Rate Boost: 4-Star Characters
--- | --- | ---
After the version 1.1 update – 2023/06/28 11:59:00 (server) | Silver Wolf (The Nihility: Quantum) | Dan Heng (The Hunt: Wind)
