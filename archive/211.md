Hello, Trailblazers,

With the departure of the Astral Express, the Express Crew has officially launched Project Astro-Warp, a long-term player-recruitment program. The goal is to provide better galactic adventure experiences to Trailblazers by listening to their voices and continuously refining and tuning them.
