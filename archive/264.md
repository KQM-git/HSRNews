Dear Trailblazers,

During the A Lost Soul event, Trailblazers can use Star Rail Special Passes for Warps.

### A Lost Soul Event Warp

During the event, the drop rate of the limited 5-star character Blade (Destruction: Wind) will be boosted.

During the event, the drop rates of the 4-star characters Arlan (Destruction: Lighting), Natasha (Abundance: Physical), and Sushang (The Hunt: Physical) will be significantly boosted.

Event Period | Drop Rate Boost: 5-Star Characters | Drop Rate Boost: 4-Star Characters
--- | --- | ---
