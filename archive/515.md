Dear Trailblazers,

After the V2.1 update, the shop's Oneiric Pouch interface will reset the first-time top-up. All Oneiric Shard bundles will reset their first top-up bonus state.

### Reset Time

After the V2.1 update

### Reset Details

- After the reset, all bundles will have their first top-up bonus refreshed.

- When a bundle that the player has not purchased before is reset, the previous first top-up bonus will not be retained, and the bonus will not be triggered twice after the reset.
