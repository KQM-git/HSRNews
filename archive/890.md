### Version Update Details

1. New Story

**■ Trailblaze Mission "Amphoreus — Through the Petals in the Land of Repose"**

Those from the past rush by in a fleeting lifetime, those from the future stretch into an endless night — oh, lost wanderer, cross that uncharted River of Souls, and step into the blooming fields of Antila flowers.

Update Time: Available after the Version 3.2 update

Requirement: Complete the Trailblaze Mission "Amphoreus" - "Passage, Reveal the Past Once More"

※ Amphoreus Trailblaze Missions can be experienced in advance through the "Finality's Vision: Leap of Trailblaze" function.

2. New Characters

**■ 5-Star character Castorice (Remembrance: Quantum)**

Castorice is a DPS who fights alongside her summoned memosprite "Netherwing: Pollux," which consumes its own HP to deal damage to enemies. The more HP consumed, the higher the damage. In combat, "Netherwing" can also take damage for endangered allies.

**■ 5-Star character Anaxa (Erudition: Wind)**

Anaxa is a DPS who can rapidly inflict multiple Weaknesses on enemies. Attacking enemies with multiple Weaknesses triggers a Skill that consumes no Skill Points. Using the Ultimate directly applies 7 types of Weaknesses to all enemies.

The spiritual and political center of Okhema, where priests gaze upon the Worldbearing Titan, and Elders debate endlessly in the circular assembly hall.
