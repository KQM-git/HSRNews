## Game Version 2.3 Optimization and Known Issues


Dear Trailblazers,

To provide a better gaming experience, the Crew will constantly adapt and improve the game and fix known issues.

### Known Issues

■2024/06/19

- It is known that in certain story dialogues for the Trailblaze Missions "Penacony — Seabiscuit" and "A Thousand Bells at Dawn," the English voiceover for the character Argenti (Erudition: Physical) is not available. This should be addressed in future updates. We appreciate your understanding.

- It is know that in certain maps, after the character Firefly (Destruction: Fire) uses her Technique, there is a chance she cannot land. This issue will be resolved soon in the future.

- It is known that in the Divergent Universe, when using the Planar Ornament Extraction function to download support characters, there is a chance of displaying the "Support Character does not exist" error for certain support characters. Trailblazers who encounter this issue can try downloading other support characters instead.

### Game Updates and Improvements Overview

■2024/06/19

- Fixes an issue where Trailblazers may stay in a locked map after leaving the Victory Zone when using the Finality's Vision function to enter locked maps early and play the Aetherium Wars. After the fix, Trailblazers will return to the "Old Weapon Testing Ground" map instead.

- Fixes an issue in the Trailblaze Continuance "Jarilo-VI — Future Market (II)" mission, where Trailblazers may not be able to operate the Automaton Stealth Bomb, preventing further progress for the mission.

- Fixes an issue where, under certain conditions, failed explorations in "Divergent Universe" may be abnormally displayed in the "Trailblazer Profile — Battle Records Showcase".
