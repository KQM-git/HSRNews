## Game Version 2.3 Optimization and Known Issues


Dear Trailblazers,

To provide a better gaming experience, the Crew will constantly adapt and improve the game and fix known issues.

### Known Issues

■2024/06/19

- It is known that in certain story dialogues for the Trailblaze Missions "Penacony — Seabiscuit" and "A Thousand Bells at Dawn," the English voiceover for the character Argenti (Erudition: Physical) is not available. This should be addressed in future updates. We appreciate your understanding.

- It is know that in certain maps, after the character Firefly (Destruction: Fire) uses her Technique, there is a chance she cannot land. This issue will be resolved soon in the future.

### Game Updates and Improvements Overview
