Dear Trailblazers,

In the upcoming Version 4.1, the version duration will be adjusted to **4 weeks**.

The Express Crew will be making adjustments to the plans for some version content:

- During Version 4.1, a brand-new limited 5-star character and their Light Cone will join the Event Warp, receiving a drop rate boost for 4 weeks. Additionally, two limited 5-star characters and their Light Cones will return in the first and second phases of Version 4.1 respectively.

- During Version 4.1, the EXP required to level up "Nameless Honor" will be reduced. This will allow Trailblazers to obtain Level Rewards faster within the 4-week period.

For more details, please stay tuned for future official announcements. Thank you for your continued support and understanding, Trailblazers.
