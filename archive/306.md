Dear Trailblazers,

After the Version 1.3 update, the Trailblaze Power System will be optimized. Please see below for more details.

### Optimization Period

Permanently after 2023/08/30 06:00:00 (global)

### Trailblaze Power Cap Increase

Trailblaze Power cap will increase from **180** to **240**.

### New Reserved Trailblaze Power System

When Trailblaze Power reaches or exceeds the max limit, **Reserved Trailblaze Power will begin to regenerate over time**. Reserved Trailblaze Power recovers 1 point every 18 minutes for a max of 2400 points.

Reserved Trailblaze Power can be withdrawn to generate an equivalent amount of Trailblaze Power (for a max of 240 points per transaction).

### Additional Information

The Trailblaze Power Optimization will be in effect from **the moment the Version 1.3 update begins**. The Trailblaze Power cap will be raised from 180 to 240 on 2023/08/30 06:00:00 (global). Below are additional clarifications based on the amount of Trailblaze Power that Trailblazers possess at the moment the maintenance starts:

- If at the start of maintenance, **Trailblaze Power ≥ 180, but does not exceed 240**, it will gradually restore to 240 over time. Once Trailblaze Power exceeds 240, it will be stored as Reserved Trailblaze Power according to a certain ratio.

- If at the start of maintenance, **Trailblaze Power ≥ 240**, Reserved Trailblaze Power will start to accumulate over time. However, Trailblaze Power exceeding 240 will not be converted into Reserved Trailblaze Power.

- If Trailblazers have Trailblaze Power that exceeds the max limit cap before the maintenance starts, the overflowed portion will not be converted into Reserved Trailblaze Power when the maintenance starts.

※ Before the Version 1.3 update and maintenance are complete, mobile push notifications will continue being sent to remind Trailblazers of their Trailblaze Power reaching **180**. After the maintenance is complete, push notifications will now remind Trailblazers when their Trailblaze Power reaches 240.
