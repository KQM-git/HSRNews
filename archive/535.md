- Fixes an issue where there is a chance for specific actions to deadlock mission progress after initiating Clockwork with the NPC Amiky in the Trailblaze Mission "Penacony" — "Why Do the Heathen Rage?"

- Fixes an issue where there is a chance that the number of Current Trailblaze Funds might be incorrectly displayed after Trailblazers contribute their Funds in the Cosmodyssey event.
