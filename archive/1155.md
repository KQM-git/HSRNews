※ Special Tip from Pom-Pom: During Version 4.0, Trace Materials for any Path can be exchanged 1:1 for a specific amount of brand-new Trace Materials for The Elation. Trailblazers, get ready ahead of time!

※ In addition to "Elation" Path Trace Materials, Version 4.0 and subsequent updates will introduce a series of new Trace Materials and stages. Some upcoming characters and Light Cones may require these new Path Materials for Trace activation and Light Cone Ascension. Trailblazers should keep an eye out for official info on future characters to avoid farming the wrong materials!
