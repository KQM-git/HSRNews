## Game Version 3.3 Optimization and Known Issues


Dear Trailblazers,

To provide a better gaming experience, the Crew will constantly make adjustments and improve the game and fix known issues.

### Known Issues

■2025/05/21

- Due to scheduling issues, some English voiceovers for certain characters are missing in specific dialogues of Version 3.3. The corresponding voiceovers will be added in future updates.

### Game Updates and Improvements Overview

■2025/05/21

- Fixes an issue of encountering a stage verification failure after the end of battle when using the trial character Trailblazer (Remembrance: Ice) in the Trailblaze Mission "Amphoreus - Night Veil, Shroud the Silent Past."

- Fixes an issue where completing the stage Demon King's Den in the "Legend of the Galactic Baseballer: Demon King" event offers only a paltry amount of Cosmic Reputation. If Trailblazers completed this stage before the fix, then the missing Cosmic Reputation will be compensated within 5 business days. (Corrected)
