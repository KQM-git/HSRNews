### Gameplay Rules

- There are a total of 3 Hero's Journeys. Upon completion of each Journey, some "Legends Past and Present" combat challenges will be unlocked.

- Once Trailblazers complete a Hero's Journey, they will receive a Protagonist Model and gradually improve the abilities within it. These abilities can help to form a more riveting experience in Legends Past and Present.

- The Protagonist Model can provide various Plot Armor combinations that can be freely adjusted, and their effects will be active in Legends Past and Present.

- Good combinations of Plot Armor in the Protagonist Model will result in higher combat scores.

- Trailblazers can use trial characters in Legends Past and Present.

- During combat, enemies will continuously appear for a limited number of rounds. Points will be awarded for dealing damage to and defeating enemies. At the end of each battle, the highest score will be updated based on the results of the current challenge.

- Increasing the Equilibrium Level will also increase enemy and trial character levels in the event.

■ Reward Claim Details

- Trailblazers can claim challenge rewards from the Rewards List after reaching certain scores in Legends Past and Present.

- When at least 10,000 points have been scored for each Legend Past and Present, a new section of the Readable Legend of the Trailblazer will be unlocked that corresponds to this particular Legend Past and Present. The key characters in the text will also experience changes depending on the characters used.

- When all sections of the Readable have been unlocked, the item Legend of the Trailblazer can be claimed and you can review the story in your Inventory among mission items.

- After claiming Legend of the Trailblazer, you can go to Mr. Xiyan to restart the battles and change the characters scribed in the story.
