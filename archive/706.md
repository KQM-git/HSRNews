Dear Trailblazers,

### Known Issues

â– 2024/09/10

- It is known that, when challenging the stage "Stagnant Shadow: Shape of Mechwolf" through the Temporary Early Access function, the game will be unable to progress. Trailblazers who encounter this problem can logout then log into the game again to resolve this issue with game progress. This problem will be resolved in future updates.
