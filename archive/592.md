### Function Access Requirements

- After the Version 2.3 update, when the Trailblazer reaches Level 21 or above, should the content support the **Finality's Vision**, you can activate the function through the **Travel Log** menu.

※ In Version 2.3, you can **pre-emptively** experience the following content through the **Finality's Vision** function (The requirements for what content can use Finality's Vision will be detailed in future announcements):

**Divergent Universe**

**Apocalyptic Shadow**

### Function Details

- Trailblazers can experience content they do not meet the requirements for **in advance** through **Finality's Vision**.

■ Missions

- After activating **Finality's Vision**, you can **ignore all existing prerequisites** and directly accept the corresponding mission.

- When switching your navigation to a mission accepted through **Finality's Vision**, the missions will **automatically be swapped** to the Finality's Vision state.

■ Map

- After activating **Finality's Vision**, you will be able to **temporarily access** the unlocked content and maps, including locations that have not been formally unlocked by your story progression.

- When in a temporarily accessed **Finality's Vision** map, you can only experience the content required for your current mission.

- If you **switch your navigation** to another mission accepted through **Finality's Vision**, the map for the current **Finality's Vision** will close and become **inaccessible** until the respective mission relating to said **Finality's Vision** map is reactivated.

### Attention

- As you are experiencing future events, the function **may affect your experience of the stories** and exploration. Use this feature with discretion.

- Finality's Vision **can only be used for the event's limited period**. Events already in the Conventional Memoir cannot be accessed via Finality's Vision.

- If you activated the Finality's Vision feature during the event period, you can continue experiencing its content when it's recorded in the "Conventional Memoir."

- When you complete all prerequisite conditions, the event will be officially unlocked, and said mission will vanish from the Finality's Vision state, causing the temporary map to be inaccessible too.

- If the event's content has not been completed, the corresponding **progress will be carried over** when you formally unlock the event.
