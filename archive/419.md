Dear Trailblazers,

To provide a better gaming experience, the Crew will constantly adapt and improve the game and fix known issues.

### Known Issues

■2023/12/01

- There is a known issue where in the "Stellar Shadowseeker" event, when the subject in frame is Pom-Pom, there is a chance that "No identifiable targets nearby" will be displayed, thus causing progress to be interrupted. If you encounter this issue, it can be resolved by restarting the game.

### Game Updates and Improvements Overview

■2023/11/29

- Fixes an issue where certain debuffs that characters fell into (such as Outrage, etc.) had a chance of causing abnormalities in the combat process when dispelled.

- Fixes an issue in the Travel Log, specifically in the event "A Foxian Tale of the Haunted," where the red dot indicator couldn't be removed under certain circumstances.

- Fixes an issue in the NPC Guinaifen's messages where some text was cut off due to excessive length, leading to incomplete display of the message option.

- Fixes an issue in the "Forgotten Hall: Memory of Chaos" where the description of the Memory Turbulence "Oath of Eternal Alliance" effect was imprecise. This fix does not change its actual effect.

■2023/11/22

- Fixes an issue where certain Trailblazers cannot obtain messages from some characters.

- Fixes an issue where, after the 1.5 version update, Trailblazers had a chance of not receiving rewards after defeating the enemy "Warp Trotter", and the "Navigation" interface showed "Warp Trotters 0/1". If Trailblazers have encountered this issue, they can defeat the enemy "Warp Trotter" again after the 1.6 version update to receive rewards normally.

- Fixes an issue where the Fyxestroll Garden map has a tendency to lag when certain Android devices are set to "Normal Mode."

- Fixes a typo in the description for Memory Turbulence "Divine Root Subdual."

- Optimizes the wording in the interface of "Simulated Universe: Swarm Disaster" when choosing to give up a "Dice Effect".

- Optimizes a user name in the "Ghostly Grove" from OmnicOverwatch to Chat_BBCNNBCGPPT.

■2023/11/16

- Fixes an issue where treasures have a chance of being abnormally displayed after the "The Specterlight Collection" is finished in the Fyxestroll Garden map. Trailblazers who encounter this issue may update and log back into the game, and the treasures should display as normal by then.

- Fixes an issue where the text descriptions are displayed abnormally in Simulated Universe's Ability Tree.

- Fixes an issue where the game's brightness is too high after activating the HDR feature on certain PC devices. Trailblazers who encountered this issue can update their game through the game launcher on their PC and restart the game after the update is completed to resolve the issue.

- Fixes an issue where the game has a chance of freezing or crashing during "A Foxian Tale of the Haunted" event for Trailblazers on certain iOS devices.

- Fixes an issue where the skill animation may be abnormal on certain iOS devices for the character Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae (Destruction: Imaginary)'s Ultimate.

- Fixes an issue where the gameplay interface of "Abacus Circuitry" is abnormally compressed when the display is set to "Normal Mode" for certain Android devices.

■2023/11/15

- Fixes an issue where the system notification "Warp info has been updated" might be triggered by certain actions performed by a Trailblazer.

- Fixes an issue where certain images are incorrect in messages during the Trailblaze Continuance.

- Fixes an issue where Huohuo (NPC)'s tail might be erroneously displayed in certain cutscenes during Trailblaze Continuance.

- Fixes an issue where there is a chance for stage verification failures for certain challenges in "A Foxian Tale of the Haunted."

- Fixes an issue where treasures might be abnormally displayed after completing the "Pathfinder" game mode in the "Fyxestroll Garden" map. Trailblazers who run into this issue can update and log back into the game before returning to the "Chess Ghost" NPC. The treasures should be displayed normally then.
