Dear Trailblazers,

The Crew is set to run version update and maintenance soon. The game will be updated to Version 3.0 "Paean of Era Nova" upon maintenance completion.

During the maintenance, Trailblazers will not be able to log in to the game. Please note the maintenance schedule and plan your gaming time accordingly. The game client must be updated after the maintenance. Due to the large size of the new game resources, we recommended Trailblazers to use a Wi-Fi connection to download the update.

### Update Time

Begins at 2025/01/15 06:00:00 (global). The update will take approximately **5** hours.

### How to Update

After maintenance for the version update begins, Trailblazers can follow the in-game instructions to update.

- PC: Exit the game, restart the launcher, then click "Update"

- Android: Enter the game and follow the instructions in the in-game pop-up window to complete the update

- iOS: Enter the App Store and tap "Update"

- PS5®: Enter the game and the game will automatically and install the update

### Compensation Details

■ Server Maintenance Compensation

Compensation: **Stellar Jade ×300**

※ The Express Crew will issue the compensation via in-game mail to Trailblazers within 5 hours after the update is complete. Please be sure to claim it before Version 3.0 ends.
