Dear Trailblazers,

During the Nessun Dorma event, Trailblazers can use Star Rail Special Passes for Warps.

### Nessun Dorma Event Warp

During the event, the drop rate of the limited 5-star character Kafka (Nihility: Lightning) will be boosted.

During the event, the drop rate of the 4-star characters Luka (Nihility: Physical), Sampo (Nihility: Wind), and Serval (Erudition: Lightning) will be boosted.

After the event ends, the 4-star character Luka (Nihility: Physical) will become available in Stellar Warp in Version 1.3, but will not be available in Departure Warp.
