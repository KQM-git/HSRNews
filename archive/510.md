Dear Trailblazers,

As Honkai: Star Rail approaches its one-year birthday, the birthday cake in the birthday mail will also have an update.

### Birthday Cake Update Details

- From 2024/04/26 00:00:00 (server), the birthday cake in the birthday mail will switch from First Voyage's Blessing to Wayfare's Blessing.

- If the Trailblazer's birthday is set for April 27, logging into the game on April 27 will get them the new birthday cake Wayfare's Blessing.

- If the Trailblazer's birthday is set for April 24, logging into the game on April 24, 2025, will get them the new birthday cake Wayfare's Blessing.

### Special Note

- If the Trailblazer logged into the game for the first time before their birthdate, they will receive the birthday mail and cake after the **anniversary date** (between April 26 and next year's April 25).

- If the Trailblazer logged into the game for the first time after their birthdate, they will receive the birthday mail and cake after the **next anniversary date** (between next year's April 26 and the following year's April 25).

â–  Example

- If the Trailblazer first logged into the game on 2024/03/27 and set their birthday as April 21 then did not log back in till 2024/04/27, they will then receive First Voyage's Blessing due to the birthday mail compensation rule. If the Trailblazer logs in within 30 days after 2025/04/21, then they will receive the birthday cake Wayfare's Blessing.

- If the Trailblazer first logged into the game on 2024/05/10 and set their birthday as May 1, then they will receive the birthday cake for the next year on 2025/05/01.
