During the maintenance, Trailblazers will not be able to log in to the game. Please note the maintenance schedule and plan your gaming time accordingly. The game client must be updated after the maintenance. Due to the large size of the new game resources, we recommend Trailblazers to use a Wi-Fi connection to download the update.
