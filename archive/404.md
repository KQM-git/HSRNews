Dear Trailblazers,

To provide a better gaming experience, the Crew will constantly adapt and improve the game and fix known issues.

### Known Issues

■2023/11/15

- There is a known issue where the "Abacus Circuitry" gameplay interface is abnormally compressed for certain Android devices that have their display settings in "Normal Mode." If Trailblazers run into this issue, they can adjust display settings to "Compatible Mode." This issue will be resolved in future updates.

- There is a known issue where the screen may be excessively bright if you are using a device with HDR functionality enabled. If Trailblazers experience this issue, you can resolve it by disabling the HDR feature on your device and restarting the game to restore things to normal.

You can turn off the HDR feature through the following methods (For other systems, please refer to the official Microsoft documentation):

Windows 11: Settings > System > Display > Brightness and Color

Windows 10: Settings > System > Display > Windows HD Color

### Game Updates and Improvements Overview

■2023/11/15

- Fixes an issue where the system notification "Warp info has been updated" might be triggered by certain actions performed by a Trailblazer.

- Fixes an issue where certain images are incorrect in messages during the Trailblaze Continuance.

- Fixes an issue where Huohuo (NPC)'s tail might be erroneously displayed in certain cutscenes during Trailblaze Continuance.

- Fixes an issue where there is a chance for stage verification failures for certain challenges in "A Foxian Tale of the Haunted."

- Fixes an issue where treasures might be abnormally displayed after completing the "Pathfinder" game mode in the "Fyxestroll Garden" map. Trailblazers who run into this issue can update and log back into the game before returning to the "Chess Ghost" NPC. The treasures should be displayed normally then.
