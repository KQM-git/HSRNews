Dear Trailblazers,

After the Version 3.0 update arrives, the new stages Cavern of Corrosion: Path of Aria and Bud of Remembrance: "Strife Ruins" Castrum Kremnos will be added.

※ After the Version 3.0 update, Trailblazers do not need to unlock the corresponding maps to challenge Calyx/Stagnant Shadow/Cavern of Corrosion/Echo of War stages and can access them directly through the Interastral Peace Guide.

※ The Calyx (Golden) stages for the Amphoreus region will come online in V3.1. Please stay tuned for future announcements.
