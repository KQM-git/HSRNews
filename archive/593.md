Dear Trailblazers,

When Version 2.3 begins, the Returner Event "Starlit Homecoming" will be **updated**. Eligible Trailblazers can complete the event **quicker** to get a 4-star Light Cone of their choice, Stellar Jades, and other rewards.

### Update Content

- Optimizes the display of the Starlit Homecoming event menu.

- **Removes** the limit of **unlocking 4 stages per day**. Adjusts the Returning Trail required for return missions, rewards, and claiming rewards. Missions in Path of Return can now be all **completed in one go**. Trailblazers can complete the event faster and obtain Memo-Keeping Light Casket.

- **Removed** the **daily limit** on Double Rewards chances. At the same time, **added 4 double reward chances for Cavern Relics and Planar Ornaments**. Trailblazers will get **42 double reward chances** for Calyxes during the Return period, and **4 double reward chances for Cavern Relics and Planar Ornaments**. You will get an additional reward on top of default drops after consuming a double reward opportunity and Trailblaze Power.

※ If Trailblazers have **activated** the Starlit Homecoming event **before the Version 2.3 update**, your event progression **will not** be **affected** by the update. However, you **will also not have the 4 double-reward chances** from Cavern Relics and Planar Ornaments obtained via the Path of Return. But the 4 stage daily unlock limit will also be waived, so you can complete all Returning Missions at once after the update.

### Event Period

From the day of activating the Starlit Homecoming event to 04:00 of the 15th day after the activation (server time)

※ If you logged in to the game and activated the Starlit Homecoming event on January 1, then the event will last until 04:00, January 15 (server time).
