Dear Trailblazers,

The Crew is set to conduct version update and maintenance soon. The game will be updated to Version 2.5 "Flying Aureus Shot to Lupine Rue" upon maintenance completion.

During the maintenance, Trailblazers will not be able to log in to the game. Please note the maintenance schedule and plan your gaming time accordingly. The game client must be updated after the maintenance. Due to the large size of the new game resources, we recommended Trailblazers to use a Wi-Fi connection to download the update.
