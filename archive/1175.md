Dear Trailblazers,

After the Version 4.0 update, new stages have been added: Cavern of Corrosion: Path of Possession, Stagnant Shadow: Shape of Soundburst, Bud of Elation: "World's End" Tavern, Bud of The Hunt: "Memortis Shore" Ruins of Time, and Calyx (Golden) series stages in the Planarcadia area.

※ Future updates will gradually introduce several new "Calyx (Crimson)" stages that drop new Trace Materials. Some upcoming characters and Light Cones may require these new materials for Trace activation and Light Cone Ascension.

### Cavern of Corrosion: Path of Possession

Successfully challenging the **Cavern of Corrosion: Path of Possession** Stage can reward you with new **Cavern Relics** such as

"Ever-Glorious Magical Girl" and "Diviner of Distant Reach."

New Cavern Relic Effects Preview:

- **"Ever-Glorious Magical Girl"**

2-pc Set: Increases CRIT DMG by 16%.

4-pc Set: The Elation DMG dealt by the wearer and their memosprites ignores 10% of targets' DEF. For each 5 accumulated Punchline allies gain, the Elation DMG dealt additionally ignores 1% of targets' DEF, which stacks up to 10 time(s).

- **"Diviner of Distant Reach"**

2-pc Set: SPD increases by 6%.

4-pc Set: Before entering combat, if the wearer's SPD is greater than or equal to 120/160, increases the wearer's CRIT Rate by 10%/18%. When the wearer uses an Elation Skill for the first time in each combat, increases all allies' Elation by 10%. This effect cannot stack.
