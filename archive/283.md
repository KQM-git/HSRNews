Dear Trailblazers,

To provide a better gaming experience, the Crew will constantly make adjustments and improve the game and fix known issues.

### Known Issues

#### ■2023/06/16

#### ■2023/06/12

#### ■2023/06/09

- There is an issue where the effect of Silver Wolf (The Nihility: Quantum)'s Eidolon 2 — Zombie Network abnormally disappears. The Crew has investigated and confirmed the specific situations that cause this issue, which are listed below. This issue will be fixed in version 1.2.

Affected situations: When boss enemies enter their next phase, after the enemy "Mara-Struck Soldier" restores HP, and when the enemy "Bronya" causes other enemies to immediately take action.

#### ■2023/06/07

- Known Issue: When the Trailblazer (Preservation: Fire) equips a Preservation Light Cone, the Details Screen does not display the Stat Bonus coming from Light Cone Abilities. This issue won't impact the actual effect of the Light Cone Abilities in question.

- It is known that there is a chance for the game to black screen when interacting with NPC Arlan during the Companion Mission "Punklorde Mentality" for specific devices. Trailblazers playing on mobile and have encountered this issue can try resolving it by going to "Settings - Other Settings - Display Settings" and switching to Normal Mode, then restarting the game.

### Game Updates and Improvements Overview

#### ■2023/06/29

- Fixes the issue with the abnormal display of reward progress in the lower right corner of the Stellar Flare event screen and challenge reward progress "Defeat six waves of enemies in 'Supergiant Star' difficulty."

For Trailblazers who have encountered this issue, please restart and update the game, and the reward progress will return to normal.
