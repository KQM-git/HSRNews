Dear Trailblazers,

After the Version 1.3 update, **Birthday Mail Distribution** rules have been **optimized**, and compensation will be sent to eligible Trailblazers.

### Distribution Rule Optimization Details

- <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">After the Version 1.3 update, Trailblazers can receive **Birthday Mail** from Pom-Pom the conductor when logging into the game within **30 days** after the birthday date shown on the Trailblazer Profile.

- If your birthday is set on Jan 1, you will receive your birthday mail as long as you log in before **Jan 30, 23:59**. Birthday Mails are valid for 30 days.

※ To receive mail, Trailblazers have to complete the Trailblaze Mission "The Blue - A Moment of Peace" to activate their mailbox.

### Re-Issue Rules

#### ■ Re-Issue Period

After the Version 1.3 update – 2023/09/28 23:59:00 (server)

#### ■ Re-Issue Requirement

Trailblazers who **meet the following requirements** can log in during the re-issue period to receive the re-issued birthday mail.

- Having already **set their birthday** in the Trailblazer Profile before the Version 1.3 update, and have **unlocked the Mailbox function**.

- The birthday date is between **Honkai: Star Rail server opening day** and 8/29 (includes 8/29), and is not earlier than the day you first accessed the game.

- **Did not log into the game** on the birthday date and **did not receive the birthday mail.**

#### ■ Example

- For example, a Trailblazer who first accessed the game on April 26 and set their birthday to **April 27** but did not log in on April 27 can receive this compensated mail after the Version 1.3 update.

- If a Trailblazer first accessed the game on April 26 and set their birthday to be **April 24**, they will receive your birthday mail normally on April 24 of the year **2024**.

※ If Trailblazers have any questions about the optimization and the re-issue of the birthday mail, please contact us via "Phone > Bug Report."
