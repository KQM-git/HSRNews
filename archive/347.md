The Astral Express was caught in a burst of strange gravitational waves during a warp. As the turbulence diminished, the flickering lights returned to normal. However...

"Hey, Trailblazer... Did you notice? The music on the record player... It changed!"

The 2023 Honkai: Star Rail "Cosmic Remix" Fan Concert has arrived! In this special performance co-created by multiple Trailblazers, familiar tunes from the game itself will be made into a whole-new auditory experience! Let's switch to a brand-new track and enjoy the endless possibilities brought by the collision of different music.
