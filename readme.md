We strive to ensure a fair, responsible, and orderly gaming environment in Honkai: Star Rail to provide an enjoyable experience to Trailblazers while protecting our players' rights. As such, the Crew would like to hereby announce that, while playing the game:

**1. It is strictly forbidden to use external plug-ins, game accelerators/boosters, scripts, or any other third-party tools that damage the balance of the game.**

Once discovered, COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. (refered to as "we" henceforth) will take appropriate actions depending on the severity and frequency of the offences. These actions include removing rewards obtained through such infringements, suspending the game account, or permanently banning the game account.

**2. It is strictly forbidden to trade or gift accounts.**

We remind all Trailblazers to protect their personal information and property. Do not engage in any account sharing or trading activities. Do not purchase third-party accounts that used to belong to other individuals, have been topped up by other individuals, or release-day accounts. Moreover, do not share or trade your own game account. Please be vigilant of frauds.

According to the Honkai: Star Rail Terms of Service, we will not address any breaches of personal privacy that arose due to the Trailblazer's own conducts and any consequent loss of money or property.

**3. It is strictly forbidden to conduct top-ups through alternative means, including, but not limited to, topping up game accounts using non-official venues, or having third parties topping up your account.**

Once discovered, we will take appropriate actions depending on the severity and frequency of the offences. These actions include, but are not limited to, removing rewards obtained through such infringements, suspending the game account, or permanently banning the game account.

**4. It is strictly forbidden to act in a way that infringes the Honkai: Star Rail Terms of Service.**

Apart from the aforementioned actions, should any Trailblazer conduct other actions that infringe the Honkai: Star Rail Terms of Service, we will take appropriate actions depending on the severity and frequency of the offenses. These actions include, but are not limited to, removing rewards obtained through such infringements, suspending the game account, or permanently banning the game account.

A fair game environment depends on every Trailblazer's individual actions. We hope that we can work together with Trailblazers to create and maintain a wholesome, welcoming, and fair gaming environment for everyone. We thank you for your continued support of Honkai: Star Rail.
