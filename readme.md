- Adjusts the descriptive text for the "Departed" state.

■ Missions

- Adjusts the performance of the Version 3.0 Trailblaze Mission "Amphoreus — Heroic Saga of Flame-Chase." Optimizes certain mission flow, including reducing dialogues, and rendering certain dialogues and mission sequences as optional content, made specific puzzles skippable, and simplified the process of solving certain puzzles, etc.

■ Events

- Optimizes the "Aptitude Showcase" character trial event. After the optimizations, in the Trial Stages, you can view battle summaries and ability descriptions for all characters in your set lineup. Before combat begins, you can switch characters within the team and activate their Techniques. Once combat starts, the Auto-Battle feature becomes available. Some Trial Stages require completing the tutorial phase before unlocking character switching and Auto-Battle functions.

- Starlit Homecoming Event Optimizations: Newly added Homecoming Assistance can grant a designated and owned character a set of Main Stat and Relic set appropriate 4-star Relics. A Gift for Returners now includes an additional reward of "Fuel Voucher" ×100. You can use Fuel Vouchers along with Trailblaze Power to Quick Farm materials from Calyx/Stagnant Shadow. When you Quick Farm, each Trailblaze Power ×10 consumed requires Fuel Voucher ×1.

■ System

- Character Warp optimization. After the optimization, Trailblazers can select seven non-featured 5-Star characters in the Character Event Warp. The first batch of customizable non-featured 5-Star characters includes: limited 5-Star characters "Fu Xuan (Preservation: Quantum)," "Blade (Destruction: Wind)," "Seele (The Hunt: Quantum)," and seven standard 5-Star characters. Trailblazers can select a total of seven characters from these ten 5-Star characters to add to the list.

- 5-Star Character Eidolon Overflow optimization. After optimization, when Trailblazers obtain a 5-Star character (including limited and standard) with max Eidolons, they will receive 1 additional "Silver Companion Spirit." For Eidolon overflow that occurred before Version 3.2, corresponding amounts of "Silver Companion Spirit" will be distributed after the Version 3.2 update.

- Adds text descriptions to certain sections in the Character Event Warp "Details" interface. These changes do not affect the actual warp probability, which remains consistent with previous versions.

- Improves the "Supplement Materials" feature when consuming materials for upgrades. After optimization, when you don't have enough of the required materials but possess the corresponding amount of lower rarity or universal materials, you can directly go to the "Material Synthesis" button on the material consumption interface to auto-complete the materials, without having to go to the "Synthesis" interface.

- Optimizes the character selection Catalog display sequence for the "Build Target" in the Interastral Peace Guide. After the optimizations, owned "Warp" characters will be displayed with priority among "My Characters."
