Dear Trailblazers,

To provide a better gaming experience, the Crew will constantly make adjustments and improve the game and fix known issues.

### Known Issues

#### ■2023/06/16

- There is an issue where the gender of the character, Trailblazer, is incorrectly displayed in the image projected in the History and Culture Museum. This issue will be fixed in version 1.2.

#### ■2023/06/12

- There is a known issue where Trailblazers cannot continue certain time-limited missions after the "Everwinter City Museum Ledger of Curiosities" event reaches the "Prosperous Glory" management phase.

#### ■2023/06/09

- There is an issue where the effect of Silver Wolf (The Nihility: Quantum)'s Eidolon 2 — Zombie Network abnormally disappears. The Crew has investigated and confirmed the specific situations that cause this issue, which are listed below. This issue will be fixed in version 1.2.

Affected situations: When boss enemies enter their next phase, after the enemy "Mara-Struck Soldier" restores HP, and when the enemy "Bronya" causes other enemies to immediately take action.

#### ■2023/06/07

- Known Issue: When the Trailblazer (Preservation: Fire) equips a Preservation Light Cone, the Details Screen does not display the Stat Bonus coming from Light Cone Abilities. This issue won't impact the actual effect of the Light Cone Abilities in question.

- It is known that there is a chance for the game to black screen when interacting with NPC Arlan during the Companion Mission "Punklorde Mentality" for specific devices. Trailblazers playing on mobile and have encountered this issue can try resolving it by going to "Settings - Other Settings - Display Settings" and switching to Normal Mode, then restarting the game.

### Game Updates and Improvements Overview

#### ■2023/07/12

- Fixes the issue where the event icon of the "Lab Assistants In Position" event would abnormally persist in the navigation after the event's completion.

#### ■2023/06/29

- Fixes the issue with the abnormal display of reward progress in the lower right corner of the Stellar Flare event screen and challenge reward progress "Defeat six waves of enemies in 'Supergiant Star' difficulty." Additionally, the statistical anomalies related to the Stellar Flare event missions in the Nameless Honor's missions for this period will also be fixed. For Trailblazers who have encountered this issue, please restart and update the game, and the reward progress will return to normal.

- Fixes the issue in the Companion Mission "A Knight Stranger" where there was a chance of entering the story cutscene and battle immediately after a losing battle or retreat. After the fix, it is now possible to change the team lineup and enter the battle again during the mission progress.

- Fixes the issue in the Companion Mission "Evanesce Like the Morning Dew" where there was a chance of the mission disappearing during the run. If Trailblazers have encountered this issue, the Crew will fix the mission progress for all affected players before 2023/06/30 23:59:00 (global).

- Fixes the issue in the Companion Mission "Frosty Blade's Trial" where if the character's HP was too low before entering battle, losing the battle would prevent the mission progress from continuing. After the fix, if the battle is lost during the mission progress, the character's HP will be restored and the battle will be reattempted.

#### ■2023/06/27

- Fixes an issue with incorrect value display after achieving the "Earthwork" and "Trauma Team Platinum Bundle" achievements. Upon achieving these achievements again after the fix, the values will be updated to reflect the correct values.

- Fixes the abnormal issue of overly high enemy strength in difficulty level III of the Warring Expedition's 'Winter Soldiers' March' and 'An Eye for an Eye' when the Equilibrium Level is ≤ 2.

- Some in-game texts in certain languages have been adjusted, optimized, and fixed. These adjustments won't affect actual gameplay. Trailblazers can switch the game's language at Phone Screen - Settings - Language Settings. Details about the adjustments can also be viewed in the corresponding Notices.

English fixes and optimizations include (actual effects have no changes):

Fixes some issues with UI text on buttons.

#### ■2023/06/12

- Fixes the discrepancy between the mission description and the actual conditions for the "Everwinter City Museum Ledger of Curiosities" event in This Period's Missions of Nameless Honor. After the fix, the correct mission description now reads "Unlock all exhibition areas in the museum and complete mission "Opportunity Makes the Thief (Part 4)"

- Fixes an issue where the gender of the character “Trailblazer” was incorrectly shown in the story animation of the Adventure Mission “Opportunity Makes the Thief (Part 3).”

- For certain Android devices, to avoid triggering issues such as the game crashing or turning to a black screen under certain circumstances (for example, when heading to specific areas in the Outlying Snow Plains or playing the Companion Mission "Punklorde Mentality"), the Crew has changed the game's default display mode to "Normal" for these Android devices.

We strive to ensure a fair, responsible, and orderly gaming environment in Honkai: Star Rail to provide an enjoyable experience to Trailblazers while protecting our players' rights. As such, the Crew would like to hereby announce that, while playing the game:

**1. It is strictly forbidden to use external plug-ins, game accelerators/boosters, scripts, or any other third-party tools that damage the balance of the game.**

Once discovered, COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. (refered to as "we" henceforth) will take appropriate actions depending on the severity and frequency of the offences. These actions include removing rewards obtained through such infringements, suspending the game account, or permanently banning the game account.

**2. It is strictly forbidden to trade or gift accounts.**

We remind all Trailblazers to protect their personal information and property. Do not engage in any account sharing or trading activities. Do not purchase third-party accounts that used to belong to other individuals, have been topped up by other individuals, or release-day accounts. Moreover, do not share or trade your own game account. Please be vigilant of frauds.

According to the Honkai: Star Rail Terms of Service, we will not address any breaches of personal privacy that arose due to the Trailblazer's own conducts and any consequent loss of money or property.

**3. It is strictly forbidden to conduct top-ups through alternative means, including, but not limited to, topping up game accounts using non-official venues, or having third parties topping up your account.**

Once discovered, we will take appropriate actions depending on the severity and frequency of the offences. These actions include, but are not limited to, removing rewards obtained through such infringements, suspending the game account, or permanently banning the game account.

**4. It is strictly forbidden to act in a way that infringes the Honkai: Star Rail Terms of Service.**

Apart from the aforementioned actions, should any Trailblazer conduct other actions that infringe the Honkai: Star Rail Terms of Service, we will take appropriate actions depending on the severity and frequency of the offenses. These actions include, but are not limited to, removing rewards obtained through such infringements, suspending the game account, or permanently banning the game account.

A fair game environment depends on every Trailblazer's individual actions. We hope that we can work together with Trailblazers to create and maintain a wholesome, welcoming, and fair gaming environment for everyone. We thank you for your continued support of Honkai: Star Rail.
