### Bug Fixes

#### ■ Characters and Light Cones

- Fixes an issue where Seele (The Hunt: Quantum)'s Trace "Rippling Waves" effect "After using a Basic ATK, Seele's next action will be Advanced Forward by 20%" wasn't triggered in the extra turn from "Resurgence".

- Fixes an issue that after Seele (The Hunt: Quantum) triggered her Talent "Resurgence" and eliminated an enemy target, the buff icons shown in Real-Time Combat View of the next wave of combats were incorrect.

- Fixes an issue that when Seele (The Hunt: Quantum) gained Invisibility after using her Technique, her model would become blurred in some positions.

- Fixes an issue where Bronya (The Harmony: Wind)'s Eidolon 2 effect sometimes was triggered with a delay.

- Fixes an issue where the description of Yanqing (The Hunt: Ice)'s Eidolon 6 was inconsistent with the actual effect. Now the description of Eidolon 6 is "If the buffs from Soulsteel Sync or the Ultimate are in effect when an enemy is defeated, the duration of these buffs is extended by 1 turn". The fix doesn't affect the actual effect of Eidolon 6.

- Fixes an issue that there was a chance for the ability effect "For every enemy on the field, increases the wearer's ATK, up to 5 stacks" of Light Cone "Night on the Milky Way (The Erudition)" to disappear abnormally.

- Fixes an issue where the ability effects of Light Cone "Day One of My New Life (The Preservation)" weren't correctly displayed in More Stats.

- Fixes an issue with the 4-star character Sampo (The Nihility: Wind) in the Simulated Universe. After using Path Resonance: Nihility to inflict Wind Shear on target enemies, and the same enemies are attacked by Sampo to be afflicted with 5 or more stacks of Wind Shear, the actual DMG caused when using Sampo's Skill on these enemies with his Eidolon 4 "The Deeper the Love, the Stronger the Hate" being active is lower than the in-game text description.

- Fixes an issue that after using the character Trailblazer's Basic ATK or Technique, an ability icon not belonging to the current Path sometimes appeared.

- Fixes the ability description of Light Cone "A Secret Vow (The Destruction)". The change doesn't affect the Light Cone ability's actual effects.

- Fixes the ability description of Light Cone "Mediation (The Harmony)". The change doesn't affect the Light Cone ability's actual effects.

- Fixes an issue where the models of some characters had slight clipping in Real-Time Combat View screen.
