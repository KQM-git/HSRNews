# [Trailblaze Power System Optimization Details](archive/306.md)
## Trailblaze Power System Optimization
![Banner](https://sdk.hoyoverse.com/upload/ann/2023/08/17/acd9f652e5531ff98e1c79f9248765b9_8734946609318645547.png)

Dear Trailblazers,

After the Version 1.3 update, the Trailblaze Power System will be optimized. Please see below for more details.

### Optimization Period

Permanently after 2023/08/30 06:00:00 (global)

### Trailblaze Power Cap Increase

Trailblaze Power cap will increase from **180** to **240**.

### New Reserved Trailblaze Power System

When Trailblaze Power reaches or exceeds the max limit, **Reserved Trailblaze Power will begin to regenerate over time**. Reserved Trailblaze Power recovers 1 point every 18 minutes for a max of 2400 points.

Reserved Trailblaze Power can be withdrawn to generate an equivalent amount of Trailblaze Power (for a max of 240 points per transaction).

### Additional Information

The Trailblaze Power Optimization will be in effect from **the moment the Version 1.3 update begins**. The Trailblaze Power cap will be raised from 180 to 240 on 2023/08/30 06:00:00 (global). Below are additional clarifications based on the amount of Trailblaze Power that Trailblazers possess at the moment the maintenance starts:

- If at the start of maintenance, **Trailblaze Power ≥ 180, but does not exceed 240**, it will gradually restore to 240 over time. Once Trailblaze Power exceeds 240, it will be stored as Reserved Trailblaze Power according to a certain ratio.

- If at the start of maintenance, **Trailblaze Power ≥ 240**, Reserved Trailblaze Power will start to accumulate over time. However, Trailblaze Power exceeding 240 will not be converted into Reserved Trailblaze Power.

- If Trailblazers have Trailblaze Power that exceeds the max limit cap before the maintenance starts, the overflowed portion will not be converted into Reserved Trailblaze Power when the maintenance starts.

※ Before the Version 1.3 update and maintenance are complete, mobile push notifications will continue being sent to remind Trailblazers of their Trailblaze Power reaching **180**. After the maintenance is complete, push notifications will now remind Trailblazers when their Trailblaze Power reaches 240.

Dear Trailblazers,

After the Version 1.3 update, **Birthday Mail Distribution** rules have been **optimized**, and compensation will be sent to eligible Trailblazers.

- If your birthday is set on Jan 1, you will receive your birthday mail as long as you log in before **Jan 30, 23:59**. Birthday Mails are valid for 30 days.

※ To receive mail, Trailblazers have to complete the Trailblaze Mission "The Blue - A Moment of Peace" to activate their mailbox.

### Re-Issue Rules

#### ■ Re-Issue Period

After the Version 1.3 update – 2023/09/28 23:59:00 (server)

#### ■ Re-Issue Requirement

Trailblazers who **meet the following requirements** can log in during the re-issue period to receive the re-issued birthday mail.

- Having already **set their birthday** in the Trailblazer Profile before the Version 1.3 update, and have **unlocked the Mailbox function**.

- The birthday date is between **Honkai: Star Rail server opening day** and 8/29 (includes 8/29), and is not earlier than the day you first accessed the game.

- **Did not log into the game** on the birthday date and **did not receive the birthday mail.**

#### ■ Example

- For example, a Trailblazer who first accessed the game on April 26 and set their birthday to **April 27** but did not log in on April 27 can receive this compensated mail after the Version 1.3 update.

- If a Trailblazer first accessed the game on April 26 and set their birthday to be **April 24**, they will receive your birthday mail normally on April 24 of the year **2024**.
