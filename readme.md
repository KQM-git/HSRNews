Dear Trailblazers,

To provide a better gaming experience, the Crew will constantly make adjustments and improve the game and fix known issues.

### Known Issues

#### ■2023/06/09

- There is an issue where the effect of Silver Wolf (The Nihility: Quantum)'s Eidolon 2 — Zombie Network abnormally disappears. The Crew has investigated and confirmed the specific situations that cause this issue, which are listed below. This issue will be fixed in version 1.2.

Affected situations: When boss enemies enter their next phase, after the enemy "Mara-Struck Soldier" restores HP, and when the enemy "Bronya" causes other enemies to immediately take action.

#### ■2023/06/07

- It is known that there is a chance for the game to black screen when interacting with NPC Arlan during the Companion Mission "Punklorde Mentality" for specific devices.

For Trailblazers who have encountered this issue, please restart and update the game, and the reward progress will return to normal.

- Fixes the issue in the Companion Mission "Evanesce Like the Morning Dew" where there was a chance of the mission disappearing during the run. If Trailblazers have encountered this issue, the Crew will fix the mission progress for all affected players before 2023/06/30 23:59:00 (global).

- Fixes the issue in the Companion Mission "Frosty Blade's Trial" where if the character's HP was too low before entering battle, losing the battle would prevent the mission progress from continuing. After the fix, if the battle is lost during the mission progress, the character's HP will be restored and the battle will be reattempted.

#### ■2023/06/27

- Fixes an issue with incorrect value display after achieving the "Earthwork" and "Trauma Team Platinum Bundle" achievements. Upon achieving these achievements again after the fix, the values will be updated to reflect the correct values.

#### ■2023/06/12

- Fixes the discrepancy between the mission description and the actual conditions for the "Everwinter City Museum Ledger of Curiosities" event in This Period's Missions of Nameless Honor.

We strive to ensure a fair, responsible, and orderly gaming environment in Honkai: Star Rail to provide an enjoyable experience to Trailblazers while protecting our players' rights. As such, the Crew would like to hereby announce that, while playing the game:

**1. It is strictly forbidden to use external plug-ins, game accelerators/boosters, scripts, or any other third-party tools that damage the balance of the game.**

Once discovered, COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. (refered to as "we" henceforth) will take appropriate actions depending on the severity and frequency of the offences. These actions include removing rewards obtained through such infringements, suspending the game account, or permanently banning the game account.

**2. It is strictly forbidden to trade or gift accounts.**

We remind all Trailblazers to protect their personal information and property. Do not engage in any account sharing or trading activities. Do not purchase third-party accounts that used to belong to other individuals, have been topped up by other individuals, or release-day accounts. Moreover, do not share or trade your own game account. Please be vigilant of frauds.

According to the Honkai: Star Rail Terms of Service, we will not address any breaches of personal privacy that arose due to the Trailblazer's own conducts and any consequent loss of money or property.

**3. It is strictly forbidden to conduct top-ups through alternative means, including, but not limited to, topping up game accounts using non-official venues, or having third parties topping up your account.**

Once discovered, we will take appropriate actions depending on the severity and frequency of the offences. These actions include, but are not limited to, removing rewards obtained through such infringements, suspending the game account, or permanently banning the game account.

**4. It is strictly forbidden to act in a way that infringes the Honkai: Star Rail Terms of Service.**

Apart from the aforementioned actions, should any Trailblazer conduct other actions that infringe the Honkai: Star Rail Terms of Service, we will take appropriate actions depending on the severity and frequency of the offenses. These actions include, but are not limited to, removing rewards obtained through such infringements, suspending the game account, or permanently banning the game account.

A fair game environment depends on every Trailblazer's individual actions. We hope that we can work together with Trailblazers to create and maintain a wholesome, welcoming, and fair gaming environment for everyone. We thank you for your continued support of Honkai: Star Rail.
