"Currency Wars: Zero-Sum Game" has received a special update! The Strategic Investment Department has **strengthened numerous characters, bonds, equipment, and investment strategies** to enhance their performance in high-difficulty matches, while also fixing various anomalies.

We will continue to **optimize the Currency Wars experience** periodically to make the gameplay even more rich and engaging!

Based on this, we have increased the power of the DoT Bond.

● DoT Bond: Increases the DoT Amplification provided by the Bond effect.

Dear Trailblazers,

We sincerely apologize for the poor experience and inconvenience caused by the extension of Version 3.8.

The Express Crew will issue **Stellar Jade ×1,000 and Fuel ×10** to every Trailblazer who has unlocked the mail feature after 2025/12/08 12:00:00 (global).

Currently, the Express Crew is constantly working on Version 4.0's game content. As such, we have extended the duration of Version 3.8, in hopes to give Trailblazers a better experience in the next world, "Planarcadia."

![img](https://sdk.hoyoverse.com/upload/ann/2025/12/07/6fd1857eff837625a7675794f32a98ea_3152062693235028079_transformed.jpg)

The threat of Destruction compelled the cosmos to unite once again, and everyone now looks toward other Aeons involved. The Express once crashed into and departed from "Planarcadia." There, Aha graced the pursuers of Elation with a reward: join THEIR game and become an "Aeon" for a minute.
