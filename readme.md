## Trailblaze Power System Optimization
![Banner](https://sdk.hoyoverse.com/upload/ann/2023/08/17/acd9f652e5531ff98e1c79f9248765b9_8734946609318645547.png)

Dear Trailblazers,

After the Version 1.3 update, the Trailblaze Power System will be optimized. Please see below for more details.

### Optimization Period

Permanently after 2023/08/30 06:00:00 (global)

### Trailblaze Power Cap Increase

Trailblaze Power cap will increase from **180** to **240**.

### New Reserved Trailblaze Power System

When Trailblaze Power reaches or exceeds the max limit, **Reserved Trailblaze Power will begin to regenerate over time**. Reserved Trailblaze Power recovers 1 point every 18 minutes for a max of 2400 points.

Reserved Trailblaze Power can be withdrawn to generate an equivalent amount of Trailblaze Power (for a max of 240 points per transaction).

### Additional Information

The Trailblaze Power Optimization will be in effect from **the moment the Version 1.3 update begins**. The Trailblaze Power cap will be raised from 180 to 240 on 2023/08/30 06:00:00 (global). Below are additional clarifications based on the amount of Trailblaze Power that Trailblazers possess at the moment the maintenance starts:

- If at the start of maintenance, **Trailblaze Power ≥ 180, but does not exceed 240**, it will gradually restore to 240 over time. Once Trailblaze Power exceeds 240, it will be stored as Reserved Trailblaze Power according to a certain ratio.

- If at the start of maintenance, **Trailblaze Power ≥ 240**, Reserved Trailblaze Power will start to accumulate over time. However, Trailblaze Power exceeding 240 will not be converted into Reserved Trailblaze Power.

- If Trailblazers have Trailblaze Power that exceeds the max limit cap before the maintenance starts, the overflowed portion will not be converted into Reserved Trailblaze Power when the maintenance starts.

※ Before the Version 1.3 update and maintenance are complete, mobile push notifications will continue being sent to remind Trailblazers of their Trailblaze Power reaching **180**. After the maintenance is complete, push notifications will now remind Trailblazers when their Trailblaze Power reaches 240.

We strive to ensure a fair, responsible, and orderly gaming environment in Honkai: Star Rail to provide an enjoyable experience to Trailblazers while protecting our players' rights. As such, the Crew would like to hereby announce that, while playing the game:

**1. It is strictly forbidden to use external plug-ins, game accelerators/boosters, scripts, or any other third-party tools that damage the balance of the game.**

Once discovered, COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. (refered to as "we" henceforth) will take appropriate actions depending on the severity and frequency of the offences. These actions include removing rewards obtained through such infringements, suspending the game account, or permanently banning the game account.

**2. It is strictly forbidden to trade or gift accounts.**

We remind all Trailblazers to protect their personal information and property. Do not engage in any account sharing or trading activities. Do not purchase third-party accounts that used to belong to other individuals, have been topped up by other individuals, or release-day accounts. Moreover, do not share or trade your own game account. Please be vigilant of frauds.

According to the Honkai: Star Rail Terms of Service, we will not address any breaches of personal privacy that arose due to the Trailblazer's own conducts and any consequent loss of money or property.

**3. It is strictly forbidden to conduct top-ups through alternative means, including, but not limited to, topping up game accounts using non-official venues, or having third parties topping up your account.**

Once discovered, we will take appropriate actions depending on the severity and frequency of the offences. These actions include, but are not limited to, removing rewards obtained through such infringements, suspending the game account, or permanently banning the game account.

**4. It is strictly forbidden to act in a way that infringes the Honkai: Star Rail Terms of Service.**

Apart from the aforementioned actions, should any Trailblazer conduct other actions that infringe the Honkai: Star Rail Terms of Service, we will take appropriate actions depending on the severity and frequency of the offenses. These actions include, but are not limited to, removing rewards obtained through such infringements, suspending the game account, or permanently banning the game account.

A fair game environment depends on every Trailblazer's individual actions. We hope that we can work together with Trailblazers to create and maintain a wholesome, welcoming, and fair gaming environment for everyone. We thank you for your continued support of Honkai: Star Rail.
